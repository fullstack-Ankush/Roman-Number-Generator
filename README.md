# Introduction
Roman numerals originated, as the name suggests, in ancient Rome more than 2,800 years ago. After the Romans’ eventual demise, numerals were still widely used during the Middle Ages. Even today, Roman numerals are prevalent in our everyday lives, showing up in clocks, movie titles, and more!

Instead of numbers like 1 and 2, Roman numerals use letters (predominantly "I" and "V").

Roman Numeral Chart
Using the chart above, "I" is 1, "V" is 5, "X" is 10, and so on…

However, when a large combination of these values gets thrown together, the value of the numeral becomes difficult to read.

Luckily, a sequence of Roman numerals can be easily converted to numbers with Python!

In this tutorial, we will be using loops, control flow statements, and built-in Python functions to convert any Roman numeral into a number. Let’s jump in!
